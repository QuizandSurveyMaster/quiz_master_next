The easiest and most flexible way to add multiple quizzes, tests, and surveys to your website.

== Description ==

The easiest and most flexible way to add multiple quizzes, tests, surveys, and contact forms to your website. This plugin allows for unlimited quizzes each with unlimited amount of questions. The plugin allows you to create the quiz, add it to any page using a customized shortcode, allows the user to take the quiz, and then saves the results. You can set up what the user sees after he or she takes the quiz based on the user's score. You can also have the plugin create a certificate for the user as well!

= Have Unlimted Quizzes, Tests, Surveys, Contact Forms, etc.. =
Each of your quizzes can have **unlimited** questions and each of those questions can have **unlimited** answers! Your questions can contain **HTML** to show images, Youtube videos and more.

= Customize Your Text =
All the text your users see can be **customized**. Everything from the text blocks throughout the quiz to the submit button.

= Different Types Of Questions =
You can have **multiple choice** (radio buttons), **true and false**, **open answer** question, **drop down**, **multiple response** (checkboxes), **number**, **captcha**, and **accept**. More types are being supported in future updates!

Each quiz can have **unlimited** results pages that can be customized with your text. Show different results pages based on the users score!

After the user takes a quiz, you can have the plugin email you and the user with results. This too can be customized with your own text.

= Very Flexible =
Your quiz can be graded with an incorrect/correct system or a points-based system. Or not at all. You ask for contact information at the beginning or the end and you decide which contact fields are required. You can decide to use all the questions or only a select few chosen at random. You can also set the number of questions per page or have all the questions on one page.

= Useful For Businesses =
The plugin features useful **statistics** that show how many times each quiz has been viewed and taken and plots the data on several different **graphs** so you can see how the quizzes are doing at a glance. Also, the plugin includes an **audit trail** that logs every action done on the admin side so you can keep up with who is doing what!

= Saves The Results For Later Use =
The plugin will **save** the results, the user's answers, the user's comments, and more!

= Math Formulas =
You can use Tex or LaTex in questions, answers, and text fields for your quiz. For assistance with LaTex, review this tutorial: [LaTeX](http://www.andy-roberts.net/writing/latex/mathematics_1) 

= Schedule Time That Quiz Is Active =
You can set up the quiz to only be active between two days. Utilize this for quizzes/surveys that are only active until a certain date.

= Other Useful Features =

* Allow the user to share the results on *social networks*
* Show all questions on one page or have only one question per page
